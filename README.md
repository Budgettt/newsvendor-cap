# newsvendor-capstone

This newsvendor simulation game was developed as part of a university capstone project to explore and demonstrate the newsvendor problem, a classic model in operations and supply chain management. The goal of the project is to provide an interactive and engaging way for players to understand the challenges of inventory decision-making under uncertainty. Players take on the role of a newsvendor who must decide how many newspapers to order before demand is known, balancing the risks of overstocking and understocking. Through gameplay, players gain insights into demand forecasting, cost optimisation, and profit maximisation.
